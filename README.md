### The GrocK has arrived on GitHub

I'm pretty new to Git, GitHub, and contribution to open source software in general.

I hope to collaborate on some projects in the future.
Nowadays I am particularly interested in making small games with open source engines and frameworks such as Godot, LÃ–VE and PyGame.
I know my way around a few languages such as Python, Lua, C++, C# and Javascript.
