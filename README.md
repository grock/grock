### The GrocK as arrived on GitHub

I'm pretty new to Git, GitHub, and contribution to open source software in general.

I hope to collaborate on some projects in the future.
Nowadays I code mostly in Python and GDScript (Godot Engine), but I know my way around other languages such as C++, C# and Javascript.
