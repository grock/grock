### The GrocK has arrived on GitHub

I'm pretty new to Git, GitHub, and contribution to open source software in general.

I hope to collaborate on some projects in the future.
Nowadays I am particularly interested in making small games with Godot and GDScript.
But I know my way around a few other languages such as Python, C++, C# and Javascript.
